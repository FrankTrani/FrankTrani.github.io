### Assembly Language:

What is assembly:

assembly goes through a assembler to convert it to 1's and 0's

Harvey Mudd Miniature Machine

halt stops the code
nop Do nothing

add r2 r2 r2 reg2 = reg2 + reg2
sub r2 r1 r4 reg2 = reg1 - reg4
mul r7 r6 r2 reg7 = reg6 \* reg2
div r1 r1 r1 reg1 = reg1 / reg1 (INTEGER division - no remainders)

setn r1 42 reg1 = 42 (anything from -128 to 127)
addn r1 -1 reg1 = reg1 - 1
copy r1 r2 r1 = r2 (copys contents of reg1 into reg2)

read r10 Read from keyboard and put into reg10
write r1 write data from reg1

jumpn 42 jump to line 42

jeqzn r1 n if r1 == 0 jump to n (jump equal to zero n)
jgtzn r1 n if r1 > 0 then jump to n
jltzn r1 n if r1 < 0 jump to n
jnezn r1 n if r1 != 0 jump to n
jumpr r1 jump to line n stored in reg1

```assembly
00 read r1          # get # from user to r1
01 read r2          # ditto, for r2
02 mul r3 r1 r2     # assign r3 = r1 * r2
03 write r3         # print what's in r3
04 halt             # stop.
```
